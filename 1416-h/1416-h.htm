<h1>MRS. LIRRIPER&rsquo;S LODGINGS</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;HOW MRS. LIRRIPER CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS</h2>
<p>Whoever would begin to be worried with letting Lodgings that wasn&rsquo;t
a lone woman with a living to get is a thing inconceivable to me, my
dear; excuse the familiarity, but it comes natural to me in my own little
room, when wishing to open my mind to those that I can trust, and I
should be truly thankful if they were all mankind, but such is not so,
for have but a Furnished bill in the window and your watch on the mantelpiece,
and farewell to it if you turn your back for but a second, however gentlemanly
the manners; nor is being of your own sex any safeguard, as I have reason,
in the form of sugar-tongs to know, for that lady (and a fine woman
she was) got me to run for a glass of water, on the plea of going to
be confined, which certainly turned out true, but it was in the Station-house.</p>
<p>Number Eighty-one Norfolk Street, Strand&mdash;situated midway between
the City and St. James&rsquo;s, and within five minutes&rsquo; walk
of the principal places of public amusement&mdash;is my address.&nbsp;
I have rented this house many years, as the parish rate-books will testify;
and I could wish my landlord was as alive to the fact as I am myself;
but no, bless you, not a half a pound of paint to save his life, nor
so much, my dear, as a tile upon the roof, though on your bended knees.</p>
<p>My dear, you never have found Number Eighty-one Norfolk Street Strand
advertised in Bradshaw&rsquo;s <i>Railway Guide</i>, and with the blessing
of Heaven you never will or shall so find it.&nbsp; Some there are who
do not think it lowering themselves to make their names that cheap,
and even going the lengths of a portrait of the house not like it with
a blot in every window and a coach and four at the door, but what will
suit Wozenham&rsquo;s lower down on the other side of the way will not
suit me, Miss Wozenham having her opinions and me having mine, though
when it comes to systematic underbidding capable of being proved on
oath in a court of justice and taking the form of &ldquo;If Mrs. Lirriper
names eighteen shillings a week, I name fifteen and six,&rdquo; it then
comes to a settlement between yourself and your conscience, supposing
for the sake of argument your name to be Wozenham, which I am well aware
it is not or my opinion of you would be greatly lowered, and as to airy
bedrooms and a night-porter in constant attendance the less said the
better, the bedrooms being stuffy and the porter stuff.</p>
<p>It is forty years ago since me and my poor Lirriper got married at
St. Clement&rsquo;s Danes, where I now have a sitting in a very pleasant
pew with genteel company and my own hassock, and being partial to evening
service not too crowded.&nbsp; My poor Lirriper was a handsome figure
of a man, with a beaming eye and a voice as mellow as a musical instrument
made of honey and steel, but he had ever been a free liver being in
the commercial travelling line and travelling what he called a limekiln
road&mdash;&ldquo;a dry road, Emma my dear,&rdquo; my poor Lirriper
says to me, &ldquo;where I have to lay the dust with one drink or another
all day long and half the night, and it wears me Emma&rdquo;&mdash;and
this led to his running through a good deal and might have run through
the turnpike too when that dreadful horse that never would stand still
for a single instant set off, but for its being night and the gate shut
and consequently took his wheel, my poor Lirriper and the gig smashed
to atoms and never spoke afterwards.&nbsp; He was a handsome figure
of a man, and a man with a jovial heart and a sweet temper; but if they
had come up then they never could have given you the mellowness of his
voice, and indeed I consider photographs wanting in mellowness as a
general rule and making you look like a new-ploughed field.</p>
<p>My poor Lirriper being behindhand with the world and being buried
at Hatfield church in Hertfordshire, not that it was his native place
but that he had a liking for the Salisbury Arms where we went upon our
wedding-day and passed as happy a fortnight as ever happy was, I went
round to the creditors and I says &ldquo;Gentlemen I am acquainted with
the fact that I am not answerable for my late husband&rsquo;s debts
but I wish to pay them for I am his lawful wife and his good name is
dear to me.&nbsp; I am going into the Lodgings gentlemen as a business
and if I prosper every farthing that my late husband owed shall be paid
for the sake of the love I bore him, by this right hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It took a long time to do but it was done, and the silver cream-jug
which is between ourselves and the bed and the mattress in my room up-stairs
(or it would have found legs so sure as ever the Furnished bill was
up) being presented by the gentlemen engraved &ldquo;To Mrs. Lirriper
a mark of grateful respect for her honourable conduct&rdquo; gave me
a turn which was too much for my feelings, till Mr. Betley which at
that time had the parlours and loved his joke says &ldquo;Cheer up Mrs.
Lirriper, you should feel as if it was only your christening and they
were your godfathers and godmothers which did promise for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And it brought me round, and I don&rsquo;t mind confessing to you my
dear that I then put a sandwich and a drop of sherry in a little basket
and went down to Hatfield church-yard outside the coach and kissed my
hand and laid it with a kind of proud and swelling love on my husband&rsquo;s
grave, though bless you it had taken me so long to clear his name that
my wedding-ring was worn quite fine and smooth when I laid it on the
green green waving grass.</p>
<p>I am an old woman now and my good looks are gone but that&rsquo;s
me my dear over the plate-warmer and considered like in the times when
you used to pay two guineas on ivory and took your chance pretty much
how you came out, which made you very careful how you left it about
afterwards because people were turned so red and uncomfortable by mostly
guessing it was somebody else quite different, and there was once a
certain person that had put his money in a hop business that came in
one morning to pay his rent and his respects being the second floor
that would have taken it down from its hook and put it in his breast-pocket&mdash;you
understand my dear&mdash;for the L, he says of the original&mdash;only
there was no mellowness in <i>his</i> voice and I wouldn&rsquo;t let
him, but his opinion of it you may gather from his saying to it &ldquo;Speak
to me Emma!&rdquo; which was far from a rational observation no doubt
but still a tribute to its being a likeness, and I think myself it <i>was</i>
like me when I was young and wore that sort of stays.</p>
<p>But it was about the Lodgings that I was intending to hold forth
and certainly I ought to know something of the business having been
in it so long, for it was early in the second year of my married life
that I lost my poor Lirriper and I set up at Islington directly afterwards
and afterwards came here, being two houses and eight-and-thirty years
and some losses and a deal of experience.</p>
<p>Girls are your first trial after fixtures and they try you even worse
than what I call the Wandering Christians, though why <i>they</i> should
roam the earth looking for bills and then coming in and viewing the
apartments and stickling about terms and never at all wanting them or
dreaming of taking them being already provided, is, a mystery I should
be thankful to have explained if by any miracle it could be.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
wonderful they live so long and thrive so on it but I suppose the exercise
makes it healthy, knocking so much and going from house to house and
up and down-stairs all day, and then their pretending to be so particular
and punctual is a most astonishing thing, looking at their watches and
saying &ldquo;Could you give me the refusal of the rooms till twenty
minutes past eleven the day after to-morrow in the forenoon, and supposing
it to be considered essential by my friend from the country could there
be a small iron bedstead put in the little room upon the stairs?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Why when I was new to it my dear I used to consider before I promised
and to make my mind anxious with calculations and to get quite wearied
out with disappointments, but now I says &ldquo;Certainly by all means&rdquo;
well knowing it&rsquo;s a Wandering Christian and I shall hear no more
about it, indeed by this time I know most of the Wandering Christians
by sight as well as they know me, it being the habit of each individual
revolving round London in that capacity to come back about twice a year,
and it&rsquo;s very remarkable that it runs in families and the children
grow up to it, but even were it otherwise I should no sooner hear of
the friend from the country which is a certain sign than I should nod
and say to myself You&rsquo;re a Wandering Christian, though whether
they are (as I <i>have</i> heard) persons of small property with a taste
for regular employment and frequent change of scene I cannot undertake
to tell you.</p>
<p>Girls as I was beginning to remark are one of your first and your
lasting troubles, being like your teeth which begin with convulsions
and never cease tormenting you from the time you cut them till they
cut you, and then you don&rsquo;t want to part with them which seems
hard but we must all succumb or buy artificial, and even where you get
a will nine times out of ten you&rsquo;ll get a dirty face with it and
naturally lodgers do not like good society to be shown in with a smear
of black across the nose or a smudgy eyebrow.&nbsp; Where they pick
the black up is a mystery I cannot solve, as in the case of the willingest
girl that ever came into a house half-starved poor thing, a girl so
willing that I called her Willing Sophy down upon her knees scrubbing
early and late and ever cheerful but always smiling with a black face.&nbsp;
And I says to Sophy, &ldquo;Now Sophy my good girl have a regular day
for your stoves and keep the width of the Airy between yourself and
the blacking and do not brush your hair with the bottoms of the saucepans
and do not meddle with the snuffs of the candles and it stands to reason
that it can no longer be&rdquo; yet there it was and always on her nose,
which turning up and being broad at the end seemed to boast of it and
caused warning from a steady gentleman and excellent lodger with breakfast
by the week but a little irritable and use of a sitting-room when required,
his words being &ldquo;Mrs. Lirriper I have arrived at the point of
admitting that the Black is a man and a brother, but only in a natural
form and when it can&rsquo;t be got off.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well consequently
I put poor Sophy on to other work and forbid her answering the door
or answering a bell on any account but she was so unfortunately willing
that nothing would stop her flying up the kitchen-stairs whenever a
bell was heard to tingle.&nbsp; I put it to her &ldquo;O Sophy Sophy
for goodness&rsquo; goodness&rsquo; sake where does it come from?&rdquo;&nbsp;
To which that poor unlucky willing mortal&mdash;bursting out crying
to see me so vexed replied &ldquo;I took a deal of black into me ma&rsquo;am
when I was a small child being much neglected and I think it must be,
that it works out,&rdquo; so it continuing to work out of that poor
thing and not having another fault to find with her I says &ldquo;Sophy
what do you seriously think of my helping you away to New South Wales
where it might not be noticed?&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor did I ever repent the
money which was well spent, for she married the ship&rsquo;s cook on
the voyage (himself a Mulotter) and did well and lived happy, and so
far as ever I heard it was <i>not</i> noticed in a new state of society
to her dying day.</p>
<p>In what way Miss Wozenham lower down on the other side of the way
reconciled it to her feelings as a lady (which she is not) to entice
Mary Anne Perkinsop from my service is best known to herself, I do not
know and I do not wish to know how opinions are formed at Wozenham&rsquo;s
on any point.&nbsp; But Mary Anne Perkinsop although I behaved handsomely
to her and she behaved unhandsomely to me was worth her weight in gold
as overawing lodgers without driving them away, for lodgers would be
far more sparing of their bells with Mary Anne than I ever knew them
to be with Maid or Mistress, which is a great triumph especially when
accompanied with a cast in the eye and a bag of bones, but it was the
steadiness of her way with them through her father&rsquo;s having failed
in Pork.&nbsp; It was Mary Anne&rsquo;s looking so respectable in her
person and being so strict in her spirits that conquered the tea-and-sugarest
gentleman (for he weighed them both in a pair of scales every morning)
that I have ever had to deal with and no lamb grew meeker, still it
afterwards came round to me that Miss Wozenham happening to pass and
seeing Mary Anne take in the milk of a milkman that made free in a rosy-faced
way (I think no worse of him) with every girl in the street but was
quite frozen up like the statue at Charing-cross by her, saw Mary Anne&rsquo;s
value in the lodging business and went as high as one pound per quarter
more, consequently Mary Anne with not a word betwixt us says &ldquo;If
you will provide yourself Mrs. Lirriper in a month from this day I have
already done the same,&rdquo; which hurt me and I said so, and she then
hurt me more by insinuating that her father having failed in Pork had
laid her open to it.</p>
<p>My dear I do assure you it&rsquo;s a harassing thing to know what
kind of girls to give the preference to, for if they are lively they
get bell&rsquo;d off their legs and if they are sluggish you suffer
from it yourself in complaints and if they are sparkling-eyed they get
made love to, and if they are smart in their persons they try on your
Lodgers&rsquo; bonnets and if they are musical I defy you to keep them
away from bands and organs, and allowing for any difference you like
in their heads their heads will be always out of window just the same.&nbsp;
And then what the gentlemen like in girls the ladies don&rsquo;t, which
is fruitful hot water for all parties, and then there&rsquo;s temper
though such a temper as Caroline Maxey&rsquo;s I hope not often.&nbsp;
A good-looking black-eyed girl was Caroline and a comely-made girl to
your cost when she did break out and laid about her, as took place first
and last through a new-married couple come to see London in the first
floor and the lady very high and it <i>was</i> supposed not liking the
good looks of Caroline having none of her own to spare, but anyhow she
did try Caroline though that was no excuse.&nbsp; So one afternoon Caroline
comes down into the kitchen flushed and flashing, and she says to me
&ldquo;Mrs. Lirriper that woman in the first has aggravated me past
bearing,&rdquo; I says &ldquo;Caroline keep your temper,&rdquo; Caroline
says with a curdling laugh &ldquo;Keep my temper?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
right Mrs. Lirriper, so I will.&nbsp; Capital D her!&rdquo; bursts out
Caroline (you might have struck me into the centre of the earth with
a feather when she said it) &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her a touch of the
temper that <i>I</i> keep!&rdquo;&nbsp; Caroline downs with her hair
my dear, screeches and rushes up-stairs, I following as fast as my trembling
legs could bear me, but before I got into the room the dinner-cloth
and pink-and-white service all dragged off upon the floor with a crash
and the new-married couple on their backs in the firegrate, him with
the shovel and tongs and a dish of cucumber across him and a mercy it
was summer-time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Caroline&rdquo; I says &ldquo;be calm,&rdquo;
but she catches off my cap and tears it in her teeth as she passes me,
then pounces on the new-married lady makes her a bundle of ribbons takes
her by the two ears and knocks the back of her head upon the carpet
Murder screaming all the time Policemen running down the street and
Wozenham&rsquo;s windows (judge of my feelings when I came to know it)
thrown up and Miss Wozenham calling out from the balcony with crocodile&rsquo;s
tears &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. Lirriper been overcharging somebody to
madness&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be murdered&mdash;I always thought so&mdash;Pleeseman
save her!&rdquo;&nbsp; My dear four of them and Caroline behind the
chiffoniere attacking with the poker and when disarmed prize-fighting
with her double fists, and down and up and up and down and dreadful!&nbsp;
But I couldn&rsquo;t bear to see the poor young creature roughly handled
and her hair torn when they got the better of her, and I says &ldquo;Gentlemen
Policemen pray remember that her sex is the sex of your mothers and
sisters and your sweethearts, and God bless them and you!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And there she was sitting down on the ground handcuffed, taking breath
against the skirting-board and them cool with their coats in strips,
and all she says was &ldquo;Mrs. Lirriper I&rsquo;m sorry as ever I
touched you, for you&rsquo;re a kind motherly old thing,&rdquo; and
it made me think that I had often wished I had been a mother indeed
and how would my heart have felt if I had been the mother of that girl!&nbsp;
Well you know it turned out at the Police-office that she had done it
before, and she had her clothes away and was sent to prison, and when
she was to come out I trotted off to the gate in the evening with just
a morsel of jelly in that little basket of mine to give her a mite of
strength to face the world again, and there I met with a very decent
mother waiting for her son through bad company and a stubborn one he
was with his half-boots not laced.&nbsp; So out came Caroline and I
says &ldquo;Caroline come along with me and sit down under the wall
where it&rsquo;s retired and eat a little trifle that I have brought
with me to do you good,&rdquo; and she throws her arms round my neck
and says sobbing &ldquo;O why were you never a mother when there are
such mothers as there are!&rdquo; she says, and in half a minute more
she begins to laugh and says &ldquo;Did I really tear your cap to shreds?&rdquo;
and when I told her &ldquo;You certainly did so Caroline&rdquo; she
laughed again and said while she patted my face &ldquo;Then why do you
wear such queer old caps you dear old thing? if you hadn&rsquo;t worn
such queer old caps I don&rsquo;t think I should have done it even then.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Fancy the girl!&nbsp; Nothing could get out of her what she was going
to do except O she would do well enough, and we parted she being very
thankful and kissing my hands, and I nevermore saw or heard of that
girl, except that I shall always believe that a very genteel cap which
was brought anonymous to me one Saturday night in an oilskin basket
by a most impertinent young sparrow of a monkey whistling with dirty
shoes on the clean steps and playing the harp on the Airy railings with
a hoop-stick came from Caroline.</p>
<p>What you lay yourself open to my dear in the way of being the object
of uncharitable suspicions when you go into the Lodging business I have
not the words to tell you, but never was I so dishonourable as to have
two keys nor would I willingly think it even of Miss Wozenham lower
down on the other side of the way sincerely hoping that it may not be,
though doubtless at the same time money cannot come from nowhere and
it is not reason to suppose that Bradshaws put it in for love be it
blotty as it may.&nbsp; It <i>is</i> a hardship hurting to the feelings
that Lodgers open their minds so wide to the idea that you are trying
to get the better of them and shut their minds so close to the idea
that they are trying to get the better of you, but as Major Jackman
says to me, &ldquo;I know the ways of this circular world Mrs. Lirriper,
and that&rsquo;s one of &rsquo;em all round it&rdquo; and many is the
little ruffle in my mind that the Major has smoothed, for he is a clever
man who has seen much.&nbsp; Dear dear, thirteen years have passed though
it seems but yesterday since I was sitting with my glasses on at the
open front parlour window one evening in August (the parlours being
then vacant) reading yesterday&rsquo;s paper my eyes for print being
poor though still I am thankful to say a long sight at a distance, when
I hear a gentleman come posting across the road and up the street in
a dreadful rage talking to himself in a fury and d&rsquo;ing and c&rsquo;ing
somebody.&nbsp; &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; says he out loud and clutching
his walking-stick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Mrs. Lirriper&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Which is Mrs. Lirriper&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then looking round and
seeing me he flourishes his hat right off his head as if I had been
the queen and he says, &ldquo;Excuse the intrusion Madam, but pray Madam
can you tell me at what number in this street there resides a well-known
and much-respected lady by the name of Lirriper?&rdquo;&nbsp; A little
flustered though I must say gratified I took off my glasses and courtesied
and said &ldquo;Sir, Mrs. Lirriper is your humble servant.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Astonishing!&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;A million pardons!&nbsp;
Madam, may I ask you to have the kindness to direct one of your domestics
to open the door to a gentleman in search of apartments, by the name
of Jackman?&rdquo;&nbsp; I had never heard the name but a politer gentleman
I never hope to see, for says he, &ldquo;Madam I am shocked at your
opening the door yourself to no worthier a fellow than Jemmy Jackman.&nbsp;
After you Madam.&nbsp; I never precede a lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he
comes into the parlours and he sniffs, and he says &ldquo;Hah!&nbsp;
These are parlours!&nbsp; Not musty cupboards&rdquo; he says &ldquo;but
parlours, and no smell of coal-sacks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now my dear it having
been remarked by some inimical to the whole neighbourhood that it always
smells of coal-sacks which might prove a drawback to Lodgers if encouraged,
I says to the Major gently though firmly that I think he is referring
to Arundel or Surrey or Howard but not Norfolk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madam&rdquo;
says he &ldquo;I refer to Wozenham&rsquo;s lower down over the way&mdash;Madam
you can form no notion what Wozenham&rsquo;s is&mdash;Madam it is a
vast coal-sack, and Miss Wozenham has the principles and manners of
a female heaver&mdash;Madam from the manner in which I have heard her
mention you I know she has no appreciation of a lady, and from the manner
in which she has conducted herself towards me I know she has no appreciation
of a gentleman&mdash;Madam my name is Jackman&mdash;should you require
any other reference than what I have already said, I name the Bank of
England&mdash;perhaps you know it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the beginning
of the Major&rsquo;s occupying the parlours and from that hour to this
the same and a most obliging Lodger and punctual in all respects except
one irregular which I need not particularly specify, but made up for
by his being a protection and at all times ready to fill in the papers
of the Assessed Taxes and Juries and that, and once collared a young
man with the drawing-room clock under his coat, and once on the parapets
with his own hands and blankets put out the kitchen chimney and afterwards
attending the summons made a most eloquent speech against the Parish
before the magistrates and saved the engine, and ever quite the gentleman
though passionate.&nbsp; And certainly Miss Wozenham&rsquo;s detaining
the trunks and umbrella was not in a liberal spirit though it may have
been according to her rights in law or an act <i>I</i> would myself
have stooped to, the Major being so much the gentleman that though he
is far from tall he seems almost so when he has his shirt-frill out
and his frock-coat on and his hat with the curly brims, and in what
service he was I cannot truly tell you my dear whether Militia or Foreign,
for I never heard him even name himself as Major but always simple &ldquo;Jemmy
Jackman&rdquo; and once soon after he came when I felt it my duty to
let him know that Miss Wozenham had put it about that he was no Major
and I took the liberty of adding &ldquo;which you are sir&rdquo; his
words were &ldquo;Madam at any rate I am not a Minor, and sufficient
for the day is the evil thereof&rdquo; which cannot be denied to be
the sacred truth, nor yet his military ways of having his boots with
only the dirt brushed off taken to him in the front parlour every morning
on a clean plate and varnishing them himself with a little sponge and
a saucer and a whistle in a whisper so sure as ever his breakfast is
ended, and so neat his ways that it never soils his linen which is scrupulous
though more in quality than quantity, neither that nor his mustachios
which to the best of my belief are done at the same time and which are
as black and shining as his boots, his head of hair being a lovely white.</p>
<p>It was the third year nearly up of the Major&rsquo;s being in the
parlours that early one morning in the month of February when Parliament
was coming on and you may therefore suppose a number of impostors were
about ready to take hold of anything they could get, a gentleman and
a lady from the country came in to view the Second, and I well remember
that I had been looking out of window and had watched them and the heavy
sleet driving down the street together looking for bills.&nbsp; I did
not quite take to the face of the gentleman though he was good-looking
too but the lady was a very pretty young thing and delicate, and it
seemed too rough for her to be out at all though she had only come from
the Adelphi Hotel which would not have been much above a quarter of
a mile if the weather had been less severe.&nbsp; Now it did so happen
my dear that I had been forced to put five shillings weekly additional
on the second in consequence of a loss from running away full dressed
as if going out to a dinner-party, which was very artful and had made
me rather suspicious taking it along with Parliament, so when the gentleman
proposed three months certain and the money in advance and leave then
reserved to renew on the same terms for six months more, I says I was
not quite certain but that I might have engaged myself to another party
but would step down-stairs and look into it if they would take a seat.&nbsp;
They took a seat and I went down to the handle of the Major&rsquo;s
door that I had already began to consult finding it a great blessing,
and I knew by his whistling in a whisper that he was varnishing his
boots which was generally considered private, however he kindly calls
out &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s you, Madam, come in,&rdquo; and I went in and
told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Madam,&rdquo; says the Major rubbing his nose&mdash;as
I did fear at the moment with the black sponge but it was only his knuckle,
he being always neat and dexterous with his fingers&mdash;&ldquo;well,
Madam, I suppose you would be glad of the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was delicate of saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; too out, for a little
extra colour rose into the Major&rsquo;s cheeks and there was irregularity
which I will not particularly specify in a quarter which I will not
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am of opinion, Madam,&rdquo; says the Major, &ldquo;that
when money is ready for you&mdash;when it is ready for you, Mrs. Lirriper&mdash;you
ought to take it.&nbsp; What is there against it, Madam, in this case
up-stairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really cannot say there is anything against it, sir, still
I thought I would consult you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said a newly-married couple, I think, Madam?&rdquo; says
the Major.</p>
<p>I says &ldquo;Ye-es.&nbsp; Evidently.&nbsp; And indeed the young
lady mentioned to me in a casual way that she had not been married many
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major rubbed his nose again and stirred the varnish round and
round in its little saucer with his piece of sponge and took to his
whistling in a whisper for a few moments.&nbsp; Then he says &ldquo;You
would call it a Good Let, Madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O certainly a Good Let sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say they renew for the additional six months.&nbsp; Would
it put you about very much Madam if&mdash;if the worst was to come to
the worst?&rdquo; said the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I hardly know,&rdquo; I says to the Major.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
depends upon circumstances.&nbsp; Would <i>you</i> object Sir for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; says the Major.&nbsp; &ldquo;Object?&nbsp; Jemmy
Jackman?&nbsp; Mrs. Lirriper close with the proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I went up-stairs and accepted, and they came in next day which
was Saturday and the Major was so good as to draw up a Memorandum of
an agreement in a beautiful round hand and expressions that sounded
to me equally legal and military, and Mr. Edson signed it on the Monday
morning and the Major called upon Mr. Edson on the Tuesday and Mr. Edson
called upon the Major on the Wednesday and the Second and the parlours
were as friendly as could be wished.</p>
<p>The three months paid for had run out and we had got without any
fresh overtures as to payment into May my dear, when there came an obligation
upon Mr. Edson to go a business expedition right across the Isle of
Man, which fell quite unexpected upon that pretty little thing and is
not a place that according to my views is particularly in the way to
anywhere at any time but that may be a matter of opinion.&nbsp; So short
a notice was it that he was to go next day, and dreadfully she cried
poor pretty, and I am sure I cried too when I saw her on the cold pavement
in the sharp east wind&mdash;it being a very backward spring that year&mdash;taking
a last leave of him with her pretty bright hair blowing this way and
that and her arms clinging round his neck and him saying &ldquo;There
there there.&nbsp; Now let me go Peggy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And by that time
it was plain that what the Major had been so accommodating as to say
he would not object to happening in the house, would happen in it, and
I told her as much when he was gone while I comforted her with my arm
up the staircase, for I says &ldquo;You will soon have others to keep
up for my pretty and you must think of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His letter never came when it ought to have come and what she went
through morning after morning when the postman brought none for her
the very postman himself compassionated when she ran down to the door,
and yet we cannot wonder at its being calculated to blunt the feelings
to have all the trouble of other people&rsquo;s letters and none of
the pleasure and doing it oftener in the mud and mizzle than not and
at a rate of wages more resembling Little Britain than Great.&nbsp;
But at last one morning when she was too poorly to come running down-stairs
he says to me with a pleased look in his face that made me next to love
the man in his uniform coat though he was dripping wet &ldquo;I have
taken you first in the street this morning Mrs. Lirriper, for here&rsquo;s
the one for Mrs. Edson.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went up to her bedroom with it
as fast as ever I could go, and she sat up in bed when she saw it and
kissed it and tore it open and then a blank stare came upon her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very short!&rdquo; she says lifting her large eyes
to my face.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Mrs. Lirriper it&rsquo;s very short!&rdquo;&nbsp;
I says &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Edson no doubt that&rsquo;s because your
husband hadn&rsquo;t time to write more just at that time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No doubt, no doubt,&rdquo; says she, and puts her two hands on
her face and turns round in her bed.</p>
<p>I shut her softly in and I crept down-stairs and I tapped at the
Major&rsquo;s door, and when the Major having his thin slices of bacon
in his own Dutch oven saw me he came out of his chair and put me down
on the sofa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I see something&rsquo;s
the matter.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t speak&mdash;take time.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
says &ldquo;O Major I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s cruel work up-stairs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes yes&rdquo; says he &ldquo;I had begun to be afraid of it&mdash;take
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then in opposition to his own words he rages
out frightfully, and says &ldquo;I shall never forgive myself Madam,
that I, Jemmy Jackman, didn&rsquo;t see it all that morning&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
go straight up-stairs when my boot-sponge was in my hand&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
force it down his throat&mdash;and choke him dead with it on the spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major and me agreed when we came to ourselves that just at present
we could do no more than take on to suspect nothing and use our best
endeavours to keep that poor young creature quiet, and what I ever should
have done without the Major when it got about among the organ-men that
quiet was our object is unknown, for he made lion and tiger war upon
them to that degree that without seeing it I could not have believed
it was in any gentleman to have such a power of bursting out with fire-irons
walking-sticks water-jugs coals potatoes off his table the very hat
off his head, and at the same time so furious in foreign languages that
they would stand with their handles half-turned fixed like the Sleeping
Ugly&mdash;for I cannot say Beauty.</p>
<p>Ever to see the postman come near the house now gave me such I fear
that it was a reprieve when he went by, but in about another ten days
or a fortnight he says again, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one for Mrs. Edson.&mdash;Is
she pretty well?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She is pretty well postman, but
not well enough to rise so early as she used&rdquo; which was so far
gospel-truth.</p>
<p>I carried the letter in to the Major at his breakfast and I says
tottering &ldquo;Major I have not the courage to take it up to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ill-looking villain of a letter,&rdquo; says
the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the courage Major&rdquo; I says again in a tremble
&ldquo;to take it up to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After seeming lost in consideration for some moments the Major says,
raising his head as if something new and useful had occurred to his
mind &ldquo;Mrs. Lirriper, I shall never forgive myself that I, Jemmy
Jackman, didn&rsquo;t go straight up-stairs that morning when my boot-sponge
was in my hand&mdash;and force it down his throat&mdash;and choke him
dead with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major&rdquo; I says a little hasty &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t
do it which is a blessing, for it would have done no good and I think
your sponge was better employed on your own honourable boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we got to be rational, and planned that I should tap at her bedroom
door and lay the letter on the mat outside and wait on the upper landing
for what might happen, and never was gunpowder cannon-balls or shells
or rockets more dreaded than that dreadful letter was by me as I took
it to the second floor.</p>
<p>A terrible loud scream sounded through the house the minute after
she had opened it, and I found her on the floor lying as if her life
was gone.&nbsp; My dear I never looked at the face of the letter which
was lying, open by her, for there was no occasion.</p>
<p>Everything I needed to bring her round the Major brought up with
his own hands, besides running out to the chemist&rsquo;s for what was
not in the house and likewise having the fiercest of all his many skirmishes
with a musical instrument representing a ball-room I do not know in
what particular country and company waltzing in and out at folding-doors
with rolling eyes.&nbsp; When after a long time I saw her coming to,
I slipped on the landing till I heard her cry, and then I went in and
says cheerily &ldquo;Mrs. Edson you&rsquo;re not well my dear and it&rsquo;s
not to be wondered at,&rdquo; as if I had not been in before.&nbsp;
Whether she believed or disbelieved I cannot say and it would signify
nothing if I could, but I stayed by her for hours and then she God ever
blesses me! and says she will try to rest for her head is bad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major,&rdquo; I whispers, looking in at the parlours, &ldquo;I
beg and pray of you don&rsquo;t go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major whispers, &ldquo;Madam, trust me I will do no such a thing.&nbsp;
How is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I says &ldquo;Major the good Lord above us only knows what burns
and rages in her poor mind.&nbsp; I left her sitting at her window.&nbsp;
I am going to sit at mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came on afternoon and it came on evening.&nbsp; Norfolk is a delightful
street to lodge in&mdash;provided you don&rsquo;t go lower down&mdash;but
of a summer evening when the dust and waste paper lie in it and stray
children play in it and a kind of a gritty calm and bake settles on
it and a peal of church-bells is practising in the neighbourhood it
is a trifle dull, and never have I seen it since at such a time and
never shall I see it evermore at such a time without seeing the dull
June evening when that forlorn young creature sat at her open corner
window on the second and me at my open corner window (the other corner)
on the third.&nbsp; Something merciful, something wiser and better far
than my own self, had moved me while it was yet light to sit in my bonnet
and shawl, and as the shadows fell and the tide rose I could sometimes&mdash;when
I put out my head and looked at her window below&mdash;see that she
leaned out a little looking down the street.&nbsp; It was just settling
dark when I saw <i>her</i> in the street.</p>
<p>So fearful of losing sight of her that it almost stops my breath
while I tell it, I went down-stairs faster than I ever moved in all
my life and only tapped with my hand at the Major&rsquo;s door in passing
it and slipping out.&nbsp; She was gone already.&nbsp; I made the same
speed down the street and when I came to the corner of Howard Street
I saw that she had turned it and was there plain before me going towards
the west.&nbsp; O with what a thankful heart I saw her going along!</p>
<p>She was quite unacquainted with London and had very seldom been out
for more than an airing in our own street where she knew two or three
little children belonging to neighbours and had sometimes stood among
them at the street looking at the water.&nbsp; She must be going at
hazard I knew, still she kept the by-streets quite correctly as long
as they would serve her, and then turned up into the Strand.&nbsp; But
at every corner I could see her head turned one way, and that way was
always the river way.</p>
<p>It may have been only the darkness and quiet of the Adelphi that
caused her to strike into it but she struck into it much as readily
as if she had set out to go there, which perhaps was the case.&nbsp;
She went straight down to the Terrace and along it and looked over the
iron rail, and I often woke afterwards in my own bed with the horror
of seeing her do it.&nbsp; The desertion of the wharf below and the
flowing of the high water there seemed to settle her purpose.&nbsp;
She looked about as if to make out the way down, and she struck out
the right way or the wrong way&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know which, for I
don&rsquo;t know the place before or since&mdash;and I followed her
the way she went.</p>
<p>It was noticeable that all this time she never once looked back.&nbsp;
But there was now a great change in the manner of her going, and instead
of going at a steady quick walk with her arms folded before her,&mdash;among
the dark dismal arches she went in a wild way with her arms opened wide,
as if they were wings and she was flying to her death.</p>
<p>We were on the wharf and she stopped.&nbsp; I stopped.&nbsp; I saw
her hands at her bonnet-strings, and I rushed between her and the brink
and took her round the waist with both my arms.&nbsp; She might have
drowned me, I felt then, but she could never have got quit of me.</p>
<p>Down to that moment my mind had been all in a maze and not half an
idea had I had in it what I should say to her, but the instant I touched
her it came to me like magic and I had my natural voice and my senses
and even almost my breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Edson!&rdquo; I says &ldquo;My dear!&nbsp; Take care.&nbsp;
How ever did you lose your way and stumble on a dangerous place like
this?&nbsp; Why you must have come here by the most perplexing streets
in all London.&nbsp; No wonder you are lost, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; And
this place too!&nbsp; Why I thought nobody ever got here, except me
to order my coals and the Major in the parlours to smoke his cigar!&rdquo;&mdash;for
I saw that blessed man close by, pretending to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah&mdash;Hah&mdash;Hum!&rdquo; coughs the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And good gracious me&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;why here he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa! who goes there?&rdquo; says the Major in a military
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;if this don&rsquo;t beat everything!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you know us Major Jackman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; says the Major.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who calls on Jemmy
Jackman?&rdquo; (and more out of breath he was, and did it less like
life than I should have expected.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why here&rsquo;s Mrs. Edson Major&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;strolling
out to cool her poor head which has been very bad, has missed her way
and got lost, and Goodness knows where she might have got to but for
me coming here to drop an order into my coal merchant&rsquo;s letter-box
and you coming here to smoke your cigar!&mdash;And you really are not
well enough my dear&rdquo; I says to her &ldquo;to be half so far from
home without me.&nbsp; And your arm will be very acceptable I am sure
Major&rdquo; I says to him &ldquo;and I know she may lean upon it as
heavy as she likes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now we had both got her&mdash;thanks
be Above!&mdash;one on each side.</p>
<p>She was all in a cold shiver and she so continued till I laid her
on her own bed, and up to the early morning she held me by the hand
and moaned and moaned &ldquo;O wicked, wicked, wicked!&rdquo;&nbsp;
But when at last I made believe to droop my head and be overpowered
with a dead sleep, I heard that poor young creature give such touching
and such humble thanks for being preserved from taking her own life
in her madness that I thought I should have cried my eyes out on the
counterpane and I knew she was safe.</p>
<p>Being well enough to do and able to afford it, me and the Major laid
our little plans next day while she was asleep worn out, and so I says
to her as soon as I could do it nicely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Edson my dear, when Mr. Edson paid me the rent for these
farther six months&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a start and I felt her large eyes look at me, but I went
on with it and with my needlework.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say that I am quite sure I dated the
receipt right.&nbsp; Could you let me look at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid her frozen cold hand upon mine and she looked through me
when I was forced to look up from my needlework, but I had taken the
precaution of having on my spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no receipt&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Then he has got it&rdquo; I says in a careless way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no great consequence.&nbsp; A receipt&rsquo;s a
receipt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that time she always had hold of my hand when I could spare
it which was generally only when I read to her, for of course she and
me had our bits of needlework to plod at and neither of us was very
handy at those little things, though I am still rather proud of my share
in them too considering.&nbsp; And though she took to all I read to
her, I used to fancy that next to what was taught upon the Mount she
took most of all to His gentle compassion for us poor women and to His
young life and to how His mother was proud of Him and treasured His
sayings in her heart.&nbsp; She had a grateful look in her eyes that
never never never will be out of mine until they are closed in my last
sleep, and when I chanced to look at her without thinking of it I would
always meet that look, and she would often offer me her trembling lip
to kiss, much more like a little affectionate half broken-hearted child
than ever I can imagine any grown person.</p>
<p>One time the trembling of this poor lip was so strong and her tears
ran down so fast that I thought she was going to tell me all her woe,
so I takes her two hands in mine and I says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No my dear not now, you had best not try to do it now.&nbsp;
Wait for better times when you have got over this and are strong, and
then you shall tell me whatever you will.&nbsp; Shall it be agreed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With our hands still joined she nodded her head many times, and she
lifted my hands and put them to her lips and to her bosom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only
one word now my dear&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there any one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked inquiringly &ldquo;Any one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one that I can bring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is wanted by <i>me</i> my dear.&nbsp; Now that may
be considered past and gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not much more than a week afterwards&mdash;for this was far on in
the time of our being so together&mdash;I was bending over at her bedside
with my ear down to her lips, by turns listening for her breath and
looking for a sign of life in her face.&nbsp; At last it came in a solemn
way&mdash;not in a flash but like a kind of pale faint light brought
very slow to the face.</p>
<p>She said something to me that had no sound in it, but I saw she asked
me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear poor dear, I think it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing somehow that she wanted me to move her weak right hand, I
took it and laid it on her breast and then folded her other hand upon
it, and she prayed a good good prayer and I joined in it poor me though
there were no words spoke.&nbsp; Then I brought the baby in its wrappers
from where it lay, and I says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear this is sent to a childless old woman.&nbsp; This
is for me to take care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trembling lip was put up towards my face for the last time, and
I dearly kissed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes my dear,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please God!&nbsp;
Me and the Major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to tell it right, but I saw her soul brighten
and leap up, and get free and fly away in the grateful look.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>So this is the why and wherefore of its coming to pass my dear that
we called him Jemmy, being after the Major his own godfather with Lirriper
for a surname being after myself, and never was a dear child such a
brightening thing in a Lodgings or such a playmate to his grandmother
as Jemmy to this house and me, and always good and minding what he was
told (upon the whole) and soothing for the temper and making everything
pleasanter except when he grew old enough to drop his cap down Wozenham&rsquo;s
Airy and they wouldn&rsquo;t hand it up to him, and being worked into
a state I put on my best bonnet and gloves and parasol with the child
in my hand and I says &ldquo;Miss Wozenham I little thought ever to
have entered your house but unless my grandson&rsquo;s cap is instantly
restored, the laws of this country regulating the property of the Subject
shall at length decide betwixt yourself and me, cost what it may.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With a sneer upon her face which did strike me I must say as being expressive
of two keys but it may have been a mistake and if there is any doubt
let Miss Wozenham have the full benefit of it as is but right, she rang
the bell and she says &ldquo;Jane, is there a street-child&rsquo;s old
cap down our Airy?&rdquo;&nbsp; I says &ldquo;Miss Wozenham before your
housemaid answers that question you must allow me to inform you to your
face that my grandson is <i>not</i> a street-child and is <i>not</i>
in the habit of wearing old caps.&nbsp; In fact&rdquo; I says &ldquo;Miss
Wozenham I am far from sure that my grandson&rsquo;s cap may not be
newer than your own&rdquo; which was perfectly savage in me, her lace
being the commonest machine-make washed and torn besides, but I had
been put into a state to begin with fomented by impertinence.&nbsp;
Miss Wozenham says red in the face &ldquo;Jane you heard my question,
is there any child&rsquo;s cap down our Airy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes
Ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; says Jane, &ldquo;I think I did see some such rubbish
a-lying there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then&rdquo; says Miss Wozenham &ldquo;let
these visitors out, and then throw up that worthless article out of
my premises.&rdquo;&nbsp; But here the child who had been staring at
Miss Wozenham with all his eyes and more, frowns down his little eyebrows
purses up his little mouth puts his chubby legs far apart turns his
little dimpled fists round and round slowly over one another like a
little coffee-mill, and says to her &ldquo;Oo impdent to mi Gran, me
tut oor hi!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O!&rdquo; says Miss Wozenham looking
down scornfully at the Mite &ldquo;this is not a street-child is it
not!&nbsp; Really!&rdquo; I bursts out laughing and I says &ldquo;Miss
Wozenham if this ain&rsquo;t a pretty sight to you I don&rsquo;t envy
your feelings and I wish you good-day.&nbsp; Jemmy come along with Gran.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And I was still in the best of humours though his cap came flying up
into the street as if it had been just turned on out of the water-plug,
and I went home laughing all the way, all owing to that dear boy.</p>
<p>The miles and miles that me and the Major have travelled with Jemmy
in the dusk between the lights are not to be calculated, Jemmy driving
on the coach-box which is the Major&rsquo;s brass-bound writing desk
on the table, me inside in the easy-chair and the Major Guard up behind
with a brown-paper horn doing it really wonderful.&nbsp; I do assure
you my dear that sometimes when I have taken a few winks in my place
inside the coach and have come half awake by the flashing light of the
fire and have heard that precious pet driving and the Major blowing
up behind to have the change of horses ready when we got to the Inn,
I have half believed we were on the old North Road that my poor Lirriper
knew so well.&nbsp; Then to see that child and the Major both wrapped
up getting down to warm their feet and going stamping about and having
glasses of ale out of the paper matchboxes on the chimney-piece is to
see the Major enjoying it fully as much as the child I am very sure,
and it&rsquo;s equal to any play when Coachee opens the coach-door to
look in at me inside and say &ldquo;Wery &rsquo;past that &rsquo;tage.&mdash;&rsquo;Prightened
old lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what my inexpressible feelings were when we lost that child can
only be compared to the Major&rsquo;s which were not a shade better,
through his straying out at five years old and eleven o&rsquo;clock
in the forenoon and never heard of by word or sign or deed till half-past
nine at night, when the Major had gone to the Editor of the <i>Times</i>
newspaper to put in an advertisement, which came out next day four-and-twenty
hours after he was found, and which I mean always carefully to keep
in my lavender drawer as the first printed account of him.&nbsp; The
more the day got on, the more I got distracted and the Major too and
both of us made worse by the composed ways of the police though very
civil and obliging and what I must call their obstinacy in not entertaining
the idea that he was stolen.&nbsp; &ldquo;We mostly find Mum&rdquo;
says the sergeant who came round to comfort me, which he didn&rsquo;t
at all and he had been one of the private constables in Caroline&rsquo;s
time to which he referred in his opening words when he said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
give way to uneasiness in your mind Mum, it&rsquo;ll all come as right
as my nose did when I got the same barked by that young woman in your
second floor&rdquo;&mdash;says this sergeant &ldquo;we mostly find Mum
as people ain&rsquo;t over-anxious to have what I may call second-hand
children.&nbsp; <i>You&rsquo;ll</i> get him back Mum.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O
but my dear good sir&rdquo; I says clasping my hands and wringing them
and clasping them again &ldquo;he is such an uncommon child!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes Mum&rdquo; says the sergeant, &ldquo;we mostly find that
too Mum.&nbsp; The question is what his clothes were worth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;His clothes&rdquo; I says &ldquo;were not worth much sir for
he had only got his playing-dress on, but the dear child!&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;All right Mum&rdquo; says the sergeant.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
get him back Mum.&nbsp; And even if he&rsquo;d had his best clothes
on, it wouldn&rsquo;t come to worse than his being found wrapped up
in a cabbage-leaf, a shivering in a lane.&rdquo;&nbsp; His words pierced
my heart like daggers and daggers, and me and the Major ran in and out
like wild things all day long till the Major returning from his interview
with the Editor of the <i>Times</i> at night rushes into my little room
hysterical and squeezes my hand and wipes his eyes and says &ldquo;Joy
joy&mdash;officer in plain clothes came up on the steps as I was letting
myself in&mdash;compose your feelings&mdash;Jemmy&rsquo;s found.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Consequently I fainted away and when I came to, embraced the legs of
the officer in plain clothes who seemed to be taking a kind of a quiet
inventory in his mind of the property in my little room with brown whiskers,
and I says &ldquo;Blessings on you sir where is the Darling!&rdquo;
and he says &ldquo;In Kennington Station House.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was dropping
at his feet Stone at the image of that Innocence in cells with murderers
when he adds &ldquo;He followed the Monkey.&rdquo;&nbsp; I says deeming
it slang language &ldquo;O sir explain for a loving grandmother what
Monkey!&rdquo;&nbsp; He says &ldquo;Him in the spangled cap with the
strap under the chin, as won&rsquo;t keep on&mdash;him as sweeps the
crossings on a round table and don&rsquo;t want to draw his sabre more
than he can help.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I understood it all and most thankfully
thanked him, and me and the Major and him drove over to Kennington and
there we found our boy lying quite comfortable before a blazing fire
having sweetly played himself to sleep upon a small accordion nothing
like so big as a flat-iron which they had been so kind as to lend him
for the purpose and which it appeared had been stopped upon a very young
person.</p>
<p>My dear the system upon which the Major commenced and as I may say
perfected Jemmy&rsquo;s learning when he was so small that if the dear
was on the other side of the table you had to look under it instead
of over it to see him with his mother&rsquo;s own bright hair in beautiful
curls, is a thing that ought to be known to the Throne and Lords and
Commons and then might obtain some promotion for the Major which he
well deserves and would be none the worse for (speaking between friends)
L. S. D.-ically.&nbsp; When the Major first undertook his learning he
says to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going Madam,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;to make our child
a Calculating Boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;you terrify me and may do the
pet a permanent injury you would never forgive yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; says the Major, &ldquo;next to my regret that
when I had my boot-sponge in my hand, I didn&rsquo;t choke that scoundrel
with it&mdash;on the spot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&nbsp; For Gracious&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; I interrupts,
&ldquo;let his conscience find him without sponges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;I say next to that regret, Madam,&rdquo; says the Major
&ldquo;would be the regret with which my breast,&rdquo; which he tapped,
&ldquo;would be surcharged if this fine mind was not early cultivated.&nbsp;
But mark me Madam,&rdquo; says the Major holding up his forefinger &ldquo;cultivated
on a principle that will make it a delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major&rdquo; I says &ldquo;I will be candid with you and tell
you openly that if ever I find the dear child fall off in his appetite
I shall know it is his calculations and shall put a stop to them at
two minutes&rsquo; notice.&nbsp; Or if I find them mounting to his head&rdquo;
I says, &ldquo;or striking anyways cold to his stomach or leading to
anything approaching flabbiness in his legs, the result will be the
same, but Major you are a clever man and have seen much and you love
the child and are his own godfather, and if you feel a confidence in
trying try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken Madam&rdquo; says the Major &ldquo;like Emma Lirriper.&nbsp;
All I have to ask, Madam, is that you will leave my godson and myself
to make a week or two&rsquo;s preparations for surprising you, and that
you will give me leave to have up and down any small articles not actually
in use that I may require from the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the kitchen Major?&rdquo; I says half feeling as if he
had a mind to cook the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the kitchen&rdquo; says the Major, and smiles and swells,
and at the same time looks taller.</p>
<p>So I passed my word and the Major and the dear boy were shut up together
for half an hour at a time through a certain while, and never could
I hear anything going on betwixt them but talking and laughing and Jemmy
clapping his hands and screaming out numbers, so I says to myself &ldquo;it
has not harmed him yet&rdquo; nor could I on examining the dear find
any signs of it anywhere about him which was likewise a great relief.&nbsp;
At last one day Jemmy brings me a card in joke in the Major&rsquo;s
neat writing &ldquo;The Messrs. Jemmy Jackman&rdquo; for we had given
him the Major&rsquo;s other name too &ldquo;request the honour of Mrs.
Lirriper&rsquo;s company at the Jackman Institution in the front parlour
this evening at five, military time, to witness a few slight feats of
elementary arithmetic.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if you&rsquo;ll believe me there
in the front parlour at five punctual to the moment was the Major behind
the Pembroke table with both leaves up and a lot of things from the
kitchen tidily set out on old newspapers spread atop of it, and there
was the Mite stood upon a chair with his rosy cheeks flushing and his
eyes sparkling clusters of diamonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Gran&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;oo tit down and don&rsquo;t
oo touch ler people&rdquo;&mdash;for he saw with every one of those
diamonds of his that I was going to give him a squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well sir&rdquo; I says &ldquo;I am obedient in this good
company I am sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I sits down in the easy-chair that
was put for me, shaking my sides.</p>
<p>But picture my admiration when the Major going on almost as quick
as if he was conjuring sets out all the articles he names, and says
&ldquo;Three saucepans, an Italian iron, a hand-bell, a toasting-fork,
a nutmeg-grater, four potlids, a spice-box, two egg-cups, and a chopping-board&mdash;how
many?&rdquo; and when that Mite instantly cries &ldquo;Tifteen, tut
down tive and carry ler &rsquo;toppin-board&rdquo; and then claps his
hands draws up his legs and dances on his chair.</p>
<p>My dear with the same astonishing ease and correctness him and the
Major added up the tables chairs and sofy, the picters fenders and fire-irons
their own selves me and the cat and the eyes in Miss Wozenham&rsquo;s
head, and whenever the sum was done Young Roses and Diamonds claps his
hands and draws up his legs and dances on his chair.</p>
<p>The pride of the Major!&nbsp; (&ldquo;<i>Here&rsquo;s</i> a mind
Ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; he says to me behind his hand.)</p>
<p>Then he says aloud, &ldquo;We now come to the next elementary rule,&mdash;which
is called&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umtraction!&rdquo; cries Jemmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; says the Major.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have here a
toasting-fork, a potato in its natural state, two potlids, one egg-cup,
a wooden spoon, and two skewers, from which it is necessary for commercial
purposes to subtract a sprat-gridiron, a small pickle-jar, two lemons,
one pepper-castor, a blackbeetle-trap, and a knob of the dresser-drawer&mdash;what
remains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toatin-fork!&rdquo; cries Jemmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In numbers how many?&rdquo; says the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One!&rdquo; cries Jemmy.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;<i>Here&rsquo;s</i> a boy, Ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; says the Major
to me behind his hand.)&nbsp; Then the Major goes on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We now approach the next elementary rule,&mdash;which is entitled&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tickleication&rdquo; cries Jemmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct&rdquo; says the Major.</p>
<p>But my dear to relate to you in detail the way in which they multiplied
fourteen sticks of firewood by two bits of ginger and a larding needle,
or divided pretty well everything else there was on the table by the
heater of the Italian iron and a chamber candlestick, and got a lemon
over, would make my head spin round and round and round as it did at
the time.&nbsp; So I says &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll excuse my addressing
the chair Professor Jackman I think the period of the lecture has now
arrived when it becomes necessary that I should take a good hug of this
young scholar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon which Jemmy calls out from his station
on the chair, &ldquo;Gran oo open oor arms and me&rsquo;ll make a &rsquo;pring
into &rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I opened my arms to him as I had opened
my sorrowful heart when his poor young mother lay a dying, and he had
his jump and we had a good long hug together and the Major prouder than
any peacock says to me behind his hand, &ldquo;You need not let him
know it Madam&rdquo; (which I certainly need not for the Major was quite
audible) &ldquo;but he <i>is</i> a boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way Jemmy grew and grew and went to day-school and continued
under the Major too, and in summer we were as happy as the days were
long, and in winter we were as happy as the days were short and there
seemed to rest a Blessing on the Lodgings for they as good as Let themselves
and would have done it if there had been twice the accommodation, when
sore and hard against my will I one day says to the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major you know what I am going to break to you.&nbsp; Our
boy must go to boarding-school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a sad sight to see the Major&rsquo;s countenance drop, and
I pitied the good soul with all my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Major&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;though he is as popular with
the Lodgers as you are yourself and though he is to you and me what
only you and me know, still it is in the course of things and Life is
made of partings and we must part with our Pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bold as I spoke, I saw two Majors and half-a-dozen fireplaces, and
when the poor Major put one of his neat bright-varnished boots upon
the fender and his elbow on his knee and his head upon his hand and
rocked himself a little to and fro, I was dreadfully cut up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&rdquo; says I clearing my throat &ldquo;you have so well
prepared him Major&mdash;he has had such a Tutor in you&mdash;that he
will have none of the first drudgery to go through.&nbsp; And he is
so clever besides that he&rsquo;ll soon make his way to the front rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a boy&rdquo; says the Major&mdash;having sniffed&mdash;&ldquo;that
has not his like on the face of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True as you say Major, and it is not for us merely for our
own sakes to do anything to keep him back from being a credit and an
ornament wherever he goes and perhaps even rising to be a great man,
is it Major?&nbsp; He will have all my little savings when my work is
done (being all the world to me) and we must try to make him a wise
man and a good man, mustn&rsquo;t we Major?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam&rdquo; says the Major rising &ldquo;Jemmy Jackman is
becoming an older file than I was aware of, and you put him to shame.&nbsp;
You are thoroughly right Madam.&nbsp; You are simply and undeniably
right.&mdash;And if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ll take a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Major being gone out and Jemmy being at home, I got the child
into my little room here and I stood him by my chair and I took his
mother&rsquo;s own curls in my hand and I spoke to him loving and serious.&nbsp;
And when I had reminded the darling how that he was now in his tenth
year and when I had said to him about his getting on in life pretty
much what I had said to the Major I broke to him how that we must have
this same parting, and there I was forced to stop for there I saw of
a sudden the well-remembered lip with its tremble, and it so brought
back that time!&nbsp; But with the spirit that was in him he controlled
it soon and he says gravely nodding through his tears, &ldquo;I understand
Gran&mdash;I know it <i>must</i> be, Gran&mdash;go on Gran, don&rsquo;t
be afraid of <i>me</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when I had said all that ever
I could think of, he turned his bright steady face to mine and he says
just a little broken here and there &ldquo;You shall see Gran that I
can be a man and that I can do anything that is grateful and loving
to you&mdash;and if I don&rsquo;t grow up to be what you would like
to have me&mdash;I hope it will be&mdash;because I shall die.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And with that he sat down by me and I went on to tell him of the school
of which I had excellent recommendations and where it was and how many
scholars and what games they played as I had heard and what length of
holidays, to all of which he listened bright and clear.&nbsp; And so
it came that at last he says &ldquo;And now dear Gran let me kneel down
here where I have been used to say my prayers and let me fold my face
for just a minute in your gown and let me cry, for you have been more
than father&mdash;more than mother&mdash;more than brothers sisters
friends&mdash;to me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he did cry and I too and we
were both much the better for it.</p>
<p>From that time forth he was true to his word and ever blithe and
ready, and even when me and the Major took him down into Lincolnshire
he was far the gayest of the party though for sure and certain he might
easily have been that, but he really was and put life into us only when
it came to the last Good-bye, he says with a wistful look, &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t have me not really sorry would you Gran?&rdquo; and when
I says &ldquo;No dear, Lord forbid!&rdquo; he says &ldquo;I am glad
of that!&rdquo; and ran in out of sight.</p>
<p>But now that the child was gone out of the Lodgings the Major fell
into a regularly moping state.&nbsp; It was taken notice of by all the
Lodgers that the Major moped.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t even the same air
of being rather tall than he used to have, and if he varnished his boots
with a single gleam of interest it was as much as he did.</p>
<p>One evening the Major came into my little room to take a cup of tea
and a morsel of buttered toast and to read Jemmy&rsquo;s newest letter
which had arrived that afternoon (by the very same postman more than
middle-aged upon the Beat now), and the letter raising him up a little
I says to the Major:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major you mustn&rsquo;t get into a moping way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jemmy Jackman Madam,&rdquo;
he says with a deep sigh, &ldquo;is an older file than I thought him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moping is not the way to grow younger Major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Madam,&rdquo; says the Major, &ldquo;is there <i>any</i>
way of growing younger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling that the Major was getting rather the best of that point
I made a diversion to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen years!&nbsp; Thir-teen years!&nbsp; Many Lodgers
have come and gone, in the thirteen years that you have lived in the
parlours Major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; says the Major warming.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many Madam,
many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should say you have been familiar with them all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a rule (with its exceptions like all rules) my dear Madam&rdquo;
says the Major, &ldquo;they have honoured me with their acquaintance,
and not unfrequently with their confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watching the Major as he drooped his white head and stroked his black
mustachios and moped again, a thought which I think must have been going
about looking for an owner somewhere dropped into my old noddle if you
will excuse the expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walls of my Lodgings&rdquo; I says in a casual way&mdash;for
my dear it is of no use going straight at a man who mopes&mdash;&ldquo;might
have something to tell if they could tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major neither moved nor said anything but I saw he was attending
with his shoulders my dear&mdash;attending with his shoulders to what
I said.&nbsp; In fact I saw that his shoulders were struck by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear boy was always fond of story-books&rdquo; I went
on, like as if I was talking to myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure this
house&mdash;his own home&mdash;might write a story or two for his reading
one day or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major&rsquo;s shoulders gave a dip and a curve and his head came
up in his shirt-collar.&nbsp; The Major&rsquo;s head came up in his
shirt-collar as I hadn&rsquo;t seen it come up since Jemmy went to school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unquestionable that in intervals of cribbage and a friendly
rubber, my dear Madam,&rdquo; says the Major, &ldquo;and also over what
used to be called in my young times&mdash;in the salad days of Jemmy
Jackman&mdash;the social glass, I have exchanged many a reminiscence
with your Lodgers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My remark was&mdash;I confess I made it with the deepest and artfullest
of intentions&mdash;&ldquo;I wish our dear boy had heard them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you serious Madam?&rdquo; asked the Major starting and
turning full round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not Major?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam&rdquo; says the Major, turning up one of his cuffs,
&ldquo;they shall be written for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Now you speak&rdquo; I says giving my hands a pleased
clap.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you are in a way out of moping Major!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between this and my holidays&mdash;I mean the dear boy&rsquo;s&rdquo;
says the Major turning up his other cuff, &ldquo;a good deal may be
done towards it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major you are a clever man and you have seen much and not
a doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin,&rdquo; says the Major looking as tall as
ever he did, &ldquo;to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dear the Major was another man in three days and he was himself
again in a week and he wrote and wrote and wrote with his pen scratching
like rats behind the wainscot, and whether he had many grounds to go
upon or whether he did at all romance I cannot tell you, but what he
has written is in the left-hand glass closet of the little bookcase
close behind you.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;HOW THE PARLOURS ADDED A FEW WORDS</h2>
<p>I have the honour of presenting myself by the name of Jackman.&nbsp;
I esteem it a proud privilege to go down to posterity through the instrumentality
of the most remarkable boy that ever lived,&mdash;by the name of JEMMY
JACKMAN LIRRIPER,&mdash;and of my most worthy and most highly respected
friend, Mrs. Emma Lirriper, of Eighty-one, Norfolk Street, Strand, in
the County of Middlesex, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland.</p>
<p>It is not for me to express the rapture with which we received that
dear and eminently remarkable boy, on the occurrence of his first Christmas
holidays.&nbsp; Suffice it to observe that when he came flying into
the house with two splendid prizes (Arithmetic, and Exemplary Conduct),
Mrs. Lirriper and myself embraced with emotion, and instantly took him
to the Play, where we were all three admirably entertained.</p>
<p>Nor is it to render homage to the virtues of the best of her good
and honoured sex&mdash;whom, in deference to her unassuming worth, I
will only here designate by the initials E. L.&mdash;that I add this
record to the bundle of papers with which our, in a most distinguished
degree, remarkable boy has expressed himself delighted, before re-consigning
the same to the left-hand glass closet of Mrs. Lirriper&rsquo;s little
bookcase.</p>
<p>Neither is it to obtrude the name of the old original superannuated
obscure Jemmy Jackman, once (to his degradation) of Wozenham&rsquo;s,
long (to his elevation) of Lirriper&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If I could be consciously
guilty of that piece of bad taste, it would indeed be a work of supererogation,
now that the name is borne by JEMMY JACKMAN LIRRIPER.</p>
<p>No, I take up my humble pen to register a little record of our strikingly
remarkable boy, which my poor capacity regards as presenting a pleasant
little picture of the dear boy&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; The picture may be
interesting to himself when he is a man.</p>
<p>Our first reunited Christmas-day was the most delightful one we have
ever passed together.&nbsp; Jemmy was never silent for five minutes,
except in church-time.&nbsp; He talked as we sat by the fire, he talked
when we were out walking, he talked as we sat by the fire again, he
talked incessantly at dinner, though he made a dinner almost as remarkable
as himself.&nbsp; It was the spring of happiness in his fresh young
heart flowing and flowing, and it fertilised (if I may be allowed so
bold a figure) my much-esteemed friend, and J. J. the present writer.</p>
<p>There were only we three.&nbsp; We dined in my esteemed friend&rsquo;s
little room, and our entertainment was perfect.&nbsp; But everything
in the establishment is, in neatness, order, and comfort, always perfect.&nbsp;
After dinner our boy slipped away to his old stool at my esteemed friend&rsquo;s
knee, and there, with his hot chestnuts and his glass of brown sherry
(really, a most excellent wine!) on a chair for a table, his face outshone
the apples in the dish.</p>
<p>We talked of these jottings of mine, which Jemmy had read through
and through by that time; and so it came about that my esteemed friend
remarked, as she sat smoothing Jemmy&rsquo;s curls:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as you belong to the house too, Jemmy,&mdash;and so much
more than the Lodgers, having been born in it,&mdash;why, your story
ought to be added to the rest, I think, one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jemmy&rsquo;s eyes sparkled at this, and he said, &ldquo;So <i>I</i>
think, Gran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he sat looking at the fire, and then he began to laugh in a
sort of confidence with the fire, and then he said, folding his arms
across my esteemed friend&rsquo;s lap, and raising his bright face to
hers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you like to hear a boy&rsquo;s story, Gran?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all things,&rdquo; replied my esteemed friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, godfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all things,&rdquo; I too replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Jemmy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here our indisputably remarkable boy gave himself a hug, and laughed
again, musically, at the idea of his coming out in that new line.&nbsp;
Then he once more took the fire into the same sort of confidence as
before, and began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, When pigs drank wine, And monkeys chewed
tobaccer, &rsquo;Twas neither in your time nor mine, But that&rsquo;s
no macker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the child!&rdquo; cried my esteemed friend, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
amiss with his brain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s poetry, Gran,&rdquo; returned Jemmy, shouting with
laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;We always begin stories that way at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gave me quite a turn, Major,&rdquo; said my esteemed friend,
fanning herself with a plate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thought he was light-headed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In those remarkable times, Gran and godfather, there was once
a boy,&mdash;not me, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says my respected friend, &ldquo;not you.&nbsp;
Not him, Major, you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he went to school in Rutlandshire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not Lincolnshire?&rdquo; says my respected friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, you dear old Gran?&nbsp; Because <i>I</i> go to school
in Lincolnshire, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure!&rdquo; says my respected friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s not Jemmy, you understand, Major?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; our boy proceeded, hugging himself comfortably,
and laughing merrily (again in confidence with the fire), before he
again looked up in Mrs. Lirriper&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;and so he was
tremendously in love with his schoolmaster&rsquo;s daughter, and she
was the most beautiful creature that ever was seen, and she had brown
eyes, and she had brown hair all curling beautifully, and she had a
delicious voice, and she was delicious altogether, and her name was
Seraphina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of <i>your</i> schoolmaster&rsquo;s
daughter, Jemmy?&rdquo; asks my respected friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly!&rdquo; replied Jemmy, pointing his forefinger at her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There now!&nbsp; Caught you!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he and my respected friend had had a laugh and a hug together,
our admittedly remarkable boy resumed with a great relish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; And so he loved her.&nbsp; And so he thought about
her, and dreamed about her, and made her presents of oranges and nuts,
and would have made her presents of pearls and diamonds if he could
have afforded it out of his pocket-money, but he couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
And so her father&mdash;O, he WAS a Tartar!&nbsp; Keeping the boys up
to the mark, holding examinations once a month, lecturing upon all sorts
of subjects at all sorts of times, and knowing everything in the world
out of book.&nbsp; And so this boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he any name?&rdquo; asks my respected friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he hadn&rsquo;t, Gran.&nbsp; Ha, ha!&nbsp; There now!&nbsp;
Caught you again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this, they had another laugh and another hug, and then our
boy went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; And so this boy, he had a friend about as old
as himself at the same school, and his name (for He <i>had</i> a name,
as it happened) was&mdash;let me remember&mdash;was Bobbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Bob,&rdquo; says my respected friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; says Jemmy.&nbsp; &ldquo;What made you
think it was, Gran?&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; And so this friend was the cleverest
and bravest and best-looking and most generous of all the friends that
ever were, and so he was in love with Seraphina&rsquo;s sister, and
so Seraphina&rsquo;s sister was in love with him, and so they all grew
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless us!&rdquo; says my respected friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
were very sudden about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they all grew up,&rdquo; our boy repeated, laughing heartily,
&ldquo;and Bobbo and this boy went away together on horseback to seek
their fortunes, and they partly got their horses by favour, and partly
in a bargain; that is to say, they had saved up between them seven and
fourpence, and the two horses, being Arabs, were worth more, only the
man said he would take that, to favour them.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; And so
they made their fortunes and came prancing back to the school, with
their pockets full of gold, enough to last for ever.&nbsp; And so they
rang at the parents&rsquo; and visitors&rsquo; bell (not the back gate),
and when the bell was answered they proclaimed &lsquo;The same as if
it was scarlet fever!&nbsp; Every boy goes home for an indefinite period!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then there was great hurrahing, and then they kissed Seraphina and
her sister,&mdash;each his own love, and not the other&rsquo;s on any
account,&mdash;and then they ordered the Tartar into instant confinement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; said my respected friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into instant confinement, Gran,&rdquo; repeated Jemmy, trying
to look severe and roaring with laughter; &ldquo;and he was to have
nothing to eat but the boys&rsquo; dinners, and was to drink half a
cask of their beer every day.&nbsp; And so then the preparations were
made for the two weddings, and there were hampers, and potted things,
and sweet things, and nuts, and postage-stamps, and all manner of things.&nbsp;
And so they were so jolly, that they let the Tartar out, and he was
jolly too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad they let him out,&rdquo; says my respected friend,
&ldquo;because he had only done his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, but hadn&rsquo;t he overdone it, though!&rdquo; cried Jemmy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; And so then this boy mounted his horse, with his
bride in his arms, and cantered away, and cantered on and on till he
came to a certain place where he had a certain Gran and a certain godfather,&mdash;not
you two, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; we both said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there he was received with great rejoicings, and he filled
the cupboard and the bookcase with gold, and he showered it out on his
Gran and his godfather because they were the two kindest and dearest
people that ever lived in this world.&nbsp; And so while they were sitting
up to their knees in gold, a knocking was heard at the street door,
and who should it be but Bobbo, also on horseback with his bride in
his arms, and what had he come to say but that he would take (at double
rent) all the Lodgings for ever, that were not wanted by this a boy
and this Gran and this godfather, and that they would all live together,
and all be happy!&nbsp; And so they were, and so it never ended!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was there no quarrelling?&rdquo; asked my respected friend,
as Jemmy sat upon her lap and hugged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; Nobody ever quarrelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did the money never melt away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; Nobody could ever spend it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did none of them ever grow older?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; Nobody ever grew older after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did none of them ever die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, no, no, no, Gran!&rdquo; exclaimed our dear boy, laying
his cheek upon her breast, and drawing her closer to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody
ever died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Major, Major!&rdquo; says my respected friend, smiling
benignly upon me, &ldquo;this beats our stories.&nbsp; Let us end with
the Boy&rsquo;s story, Major, for the Boy&rsquo;s story is the best
that is ever told!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In submission to which request on the part of the best of women,
I have here noted it down as faithfully as my best abilities, coupled
with my best intentions, would admit, subscribing it with my name,</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
