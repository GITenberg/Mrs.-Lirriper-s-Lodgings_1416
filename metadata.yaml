description: Charles Dickens' absorbing tale of people thrown together by chance,
  moving from the squalor of Victorian London to the warmer climes of southern France.
  Recently widowed, Mrs. Lirriper devotes her energies to attending to the needs of
  her assorted lodgers; but when a newborn child is abandoned to her care, her responsibilities
  grow to new levels. She enlists longtime lodger, the Major, into the role of "guardian,"
  and the two develop an increasing affection for the boy. In an effort to entertain
  the growing lad, they relate the stories of their fellow lodgers, little knowing
  that they are about to embark on their own real-life tale of impending death, guilty
  secrets, and mysterious legacies.
